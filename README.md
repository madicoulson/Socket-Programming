# CS4065 Project 2: A Simple Bulletin Board Using Socket Programming
Team Members: Preston Buterbaugh, Madi Coulson, and Chloe Belletti

## Goal of Project:
The goal of this project was to build a bulletin board socket program in which the user can join the server along with one of five different groups. The user is able to post messages to their group's message board, retreive a list of users in their group, retreive the contents of a specified message in their group, leave the group, and exit the program. Along with this, the user is notfied when other users join, post messages, or leave their group. We implement this through a Java command line server and Python client application. To communicate protocol messages, JSON representations are used.

## Instructions to Run Program:
In order to run the program, the following steps should be followed:
1. Start up the Java server, ____, by compiling and running the Java program. You should get the output: ______
2. Start up the Python client, _____, by running the Python program You should get a list of options, including: ________.
3. The first option you want to choose is connect. On the command line, type: connect localhost 6789. This will connect you to the server running on localhost and port 6789. If the server is not running on your localhost, you will need to substitue this with the correct IP address.
4. Next, you will want to choose a group to join. Join a group by typing: groupjoin <groupnumber>. groupnumber must be 1-5.
5. Now, you are connected and in a group. You can now post messages to the group, view messages in the group, view users in the group, leave the group, or exit the program. For details on how to run each of the commands, see the section Usability Notes.

## Usablity Notes:
A description and the corresponding command for the client program is described below:
* connect:
